              <p class="card__text--short">AI is a branch of computer science related to machines. During the second half of the 20th century, AI has been considered any work done by machines that did not require the intelligence of a human being for completing a particular task.</p>

              <p class="card__text">AI is a branch of computer science related to machines. During the second half of the 20th century, AI has been considered any work done by machines that did not require the intelligence of a human being for completing a particular task. This definition was attributed to the fathers of artificial intelligence known as Minsky and McCarthy. The current definition is the ability of robots controlled by a computer to solve problems that require the intellect and skills of human beings as the ability to reason, generalize and ascertain data.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Types of Artificial Intelligence
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">AI can be divided into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is often considered as weak. It is specific task-oriented. General AI is considered to be strong. It can do a wide range of tasks, unlike Narrow AI.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Narrow AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This is seen in the computers we use. This type of AI is generally focused on a single task which it can do very well. Examples are virtual assistants that recognize speech and language, and cars that can self-drive. This type of artificial intelligence can only do a specified task given taught to them but cannot do anything more. Responding to customers questions and concerns is a common form of narrow artificial intelligence along with cooperating with other artificial intelligence for the tasks of hotel booking, helping radiologists to find tumors through X-rays that have the potential to turn dangerous, detecting troubles with elevators, preparing a three-dimensional model of the world, etc. It can only do tasks that are taught to them, unlike humans, and this is one of its biggest drawbacks.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                General AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This type of AI can be found in more refined systems. It can do several tasks that a human can do and use human-like intelligence to solve various problems ranging from a simple task such as cutting nails and hair and watering plants to a high skill task such as reasoning based on collected data. The themes of western movies are highly influenced by general AI. The data scientists argue that general artificial intelligence will rise to a huge extent by the year 2040-2050, and it would be the future of this universe by the year 2075, and it would dominate the whole world, including human beings. It would also be a threat to the human species. General AI is believed to surpass the cognitive human performance in virtual domains. However, many scientists have divided opinions over this. Many scientists believe that general AI is nowhere near becoming the future of the world. The pioneers of general artificial intelligence, such as Demis Hassabis, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun, also have this view. They believe that there is no concrete basis for the fear that the human species will be threatened by general artificial intelligence in the near future.</p>

              <p class="card__text--short">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably. However, AI and machine learning are not the same and there are some key differences that I will discuss here. So, without further ado, let&#39;s go into the details to know the difference between AI and machine learning.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is a machine&#39;s ability to solve tasks that are commonly done by intelligent beings or humans. So, AI allows machines to execute tasks smartly by imitating human abilities. On the other hand, machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence. It is the process of learning from data that is fed into the machine in the form of algorithms.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Artificial Intelligence and its Real-World Benefits
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is the science of training computers and machines to perform tasks with human-like intelligence and reasoning skills. With AI in your computer system, you can speak in any accent or any language as long as there is data on the internet about it. AI will be able to pick it up and follow your commands.</p>

              <p class="card__text">We can see the application of this technology in a lot of the online platforms that we enjoy today, such as retail stores, healthcare, finance, fraud detection, weather updates, traffic information and much more. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that AI cannot do.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Machine Learning and its Process
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This is based on the idea that machines should be able to learn and adapt through experience. Machine learning can be done by giving the computer examples in the form of algorithms. This is how it will learn what to do on the basis of the given examples.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Once the algorithm determines how to draw the right conclusions for any input, it will then apply the knowledge to new data. And that is the life cycle of machine learning. The first step is to collect data for a question you have. Then the next step is to train the algorithm by feeding it to the machine.</p>

              <p class="card__text">You will have to let the machine try it out, then collect feedback and use the information you gained to make the algorithm better and repeat the cycle until you get your desired results. This is how the feedback works for these systems.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Machine learning uses statistics and physics to find specific information within the data, without any specific programming about where to look or what conclusions to draw. These days&#39; machine learning and artificial intelligence are applied to all sorts of technology. Some of them include CT scan, MRI machines, car navigation systems and food apps, to name a few.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Conclusion
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In simple words, artificial intelligence is the science of creating machines that have human-like properties of reasoning and problem-solving. And this allows machines to learn and make decisions from past data without explicit programming. In short, the goal of AI is to create intelligent machines. And it does that by combining machine learning and deep learning etc.</p>

              <p class="card__text--short">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans. Also, it is a field of study that works on making a computer smarter. The term AI was coined in 1955 by John McCarthy. Let&#39;s find out more about the AI history and some facts.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Generally, this term refers to a machine that has human-like cognitive abilities. For instance, an AI system can learn and solve some problems like us. An ideal intelligent machine can boost its success rate.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Today, the term AI is used to understand human speech and compete at a much higher level in some strategic games like Chess and Go, interpretation of complex data and self-driving cars.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The goal of AI research is developing computer programs that have the ability to think logically and solve problems. However, many apps can solve a lot of problems. Doing math and searching different databases is something that computers can do much better than humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Also, AI involves a lot of different fields, such as philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, math and computer science. Researchers are hopeful to develop an AI system that can solve a lot of problems rather than concentrate on just one. Aside from this, researchers are also working hard to develop emotional and creative AI. For this purpose, they have given a go to a lot of tools and approaches.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                History of AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In history, you can find many objects that can be considered Artificially Intelligent. For the first time, these objects of AI appeared in Greek myths, such as Talos of Crete. Aside from this, humanoid robots were designed by Al-Jazari, and Yan Shi.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The ancient Greek mathematicians and Greek philosophers developed formal logic. This gave birth to the idea of computer later on in the 19th century. According to the theory of computation by Alan Turing, all mathematical problems can be solved through the processing of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. Aside from this, advancements in cybernetics, information theory, and neurology convinced many researchers that it was possible to develop an electronic brain.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The research studies on AI began after a conference held at Dartmouth College in the 19th century. During this brainstorming session, many people showed their interest in Artificial Intelligence. During the conference, the researchers presented programs that could beat humans at solving word problems. Also, the department of Defense began investing lots of funds in AI labs and research across the globe.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Unfortunately, most researchers underestimate the complexity of problems. Their tools don&#39;t give common sense or emotions to computers. In 1980s, AI research got a reboot because of the popularity of many systems that mimicked human knowledge. By the end of 1985, around one billion dollars were invested in AI. The advent of faster computers was convincing enough for British and US government to provide plenty of funds for AI once again.</p>

              <p class="card__text">So, this is an introduction to AI that contains history and facts. Hopefully, you will find this article full of useful and interesting information.</p>

During the second half of the 20th century, AI has been considered any work done by machines that did not require the intelligence of a human being for completing a particular task. This definition was attributed to the fathers of artificial intelligence known as Minsky and McCarthy. The current definition is the ability of robots controlled by a computer to solve problems that require the intellect and skills of human beings as the ability to reason, generalize and ascertain data.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Types of Artificial Intelligence
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">AI can be divided into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI is often considered as weak. It is specific task-oriented. General AI is considered to be strong. It can do a wide range of tasks, unlike Narrow AI.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Narrow AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This is seen in the computers we use. This type of AI is generally focused on a single task which it can do very well. Examples are virtual assistants that recognize speech and language, and cars that can self-drive. This type of artificial intelligence can only do a specified task given taught to them but cannot do anything more. Responding to customers questions and concerns is a common form of narrow artificial intelligence along with cooperating with other artificial intelligence for the tasks of hotel booking, helping radiologists to find tumors through X-rays that have the potential to turn dangerous, detecting troubles with elevators, preparing a three-dimensional model of the world, etc. It can only do tasks that are taught to them, unlike humans, and this is one of its biggest drawbacks.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                General AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This type of AI can be found in more refined systems. It can do several tasks that a human can do and use human-like intelligence to solve various problems ranging from a simple task such as cutting nails and hair and watering plants to a high skill task such as reasoning based on collected data. The themes of western movies are highly influenced by general AI. The data scientists argue that general artificial intelligence will rise to a huge extent by the year 2040-2050, and it would be the future of this universe by the year 2075, and it would dominate the whole world, including human beings. It would also be a threat to the human species. General AI is believed to surpass the cognitive human performance in virtual domains. However, many scientists have divided opinions over this. Many scientists believe that general AI is nowhere near becoming the future of the world. The pioneers of general artificial intelligence, such as Demis Hassabis, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun, also have this view. They believe that there is no concrete basis for the fear that the human species will be threatened by general artificial intelligence in the near future.</p>

              <h3 class="heading heading--tertiary mb-1">Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h3>
              <p class="card__text--short">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably. However, AI and machine learning are not the same and there are some key differences that I will discuss here. So, without further ado, let&#39;s go into the details to know the difference between AI and machine learning.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is a machine&#39;s ability to solve tasks that are commonly done by intelligent beings or humans. So, AI allows machines to execute tasks smartly by imitating human abilities. On the other hand, machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence. It is the process of learning from data that is fed into the machine in the form of algorithms.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Artificial Intelligence and its Real-World Benefits
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is the science of training computers and machines to perform tasks with human-like intelligence and reasoning skills. With AI in your computer system, you can speak in any accent or any language as long as there is data on the internet about it. AI will be able to pick it up and follow your commands.</p>

              <p class="card__text">We can see the application of this technology in a lot of the online platforms that we enjoy today, such as retail stores, healthcare, finance, fraud detection, weather updates, traffic information and much more. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that AI cannot do.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Machine Learning and its Process
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This is based on the idea that machines should be able to learn and adapt through experience. Machine learning can be done by giving the computer examples in the form of algorithms. This is how it will learn what to do on the basis of the given examples.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Once the algorithm determines how to draw the right conclusions for any input, it will then apply the knowledge to new data. And that is the life cycle of machine learning. The first step is to collect data for a question you have. Then the next step is to train the algorithm by feeding it to the machine.</p>

              <p class="card__text">You will have to let the machine try it out, then collect feedback and use the information you gained to make the algorithm better and repeat the cycle until you get your desired results. This is how the feedback works for these systems.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Machine learning uses statistics and physics to find specific information within the data, without any specific programming about where to look or what conclusions to draw. These days&#39; machine learning and artificial intelligence are applied to all sorts of technology. Some of them include CT scan, MRI machines, car navigation systems and food apps, to name a few.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Conclusion
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In simple words, artificial intelligence is the science of creating machines that have human-like properties of reasoning and problem-solving. And this allows machines to learn and make decisions from past data without explicit programming. In short, the goal of AI is to create intelligent machines. And it does that by combining machine learning and deep learning etc.</p>

              <p class="card__text--short">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans. Also, it is a field of study that works on making a computer smarter. The term AI was coined in 1955 by John McCarthy. Let&#39;s find out more about the AI history and some facts.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Generally, this term refers to a machine that has human-like cognitive abilities. For instance, an AI system can learn and solve some problems like us. An ideal intelligent machine can boost its success rate.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Today, the term AI is used to understand human speech and compete at a much higher level in some strategic games like Chess and Go, interpretation of complex data and self-driving cars.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The goal of AI research is developing computer programs that have the ability to think logically and solve problems. However, many apps can solve a lot of problems. Doing math and searching different databases is something that computers can do much better than humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Also, AI involves a lot of different fields, such as philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, math and computer science. Researchers are hopeful to develop an AI system that can solve a lot of problems rather than concentrate on just one. Aside from this, researchers are also working hard to develop emotional and creative AI. For this purpose, they have given a go to a lot of tools and approaches.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                History of AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In history, you can find many objects that can be considered Artificially Intelligent. For the first time, these objects of AI appeared in Greek myths, such as Talos of Crete. Aside from this, humanoid robots were designed by Al-Jazari, and Yan Shi.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The ancient Greek mathematicians and Greek philosophers developed formal logic. This gave birth to the idea of computer later on in the 19th century. According to the theory of computation by Alan Turing, all mathematical problems can be solved through the processing of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. Aside from this, advancements in cybernetics, information theory, and neurology convinced many researchers that it was possible to develop an electronic brain.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The research studies on AI began after a conference held at Dartmouth College in the 19th century. During this brainstorming session, many people showed their interest in Artificial Intelligence. During the conference, the researchers presented programs that could beat humans at solving word problems. Also, the department of Defense began investing lots of funds in AI labs and research across the globe.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Unfortunately, most researchers underestimate the complexity of problems. Their tools don&#39;t give common sense or emotions to computers. In 1980s, AI research got a reboot because of the popularity of many systems that mimicked human knowledge. By the end of 1985, around one billion dollars were invested in AI. The advent of faster computers was convincing enough for British and US government to provide plenty of funds for AI once again.</p>

              <p class="card__text">So, this is an introduction to AI that contains history and facts. Hopefully, you will find this article full of useful and interesting information.</p>

              <p class="card__text--short">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are part of the computer science field. Both terms are correlated and most people often use them interchangeably. However, AI and machine learning are not the same and there are some key differences that I will discuss here. So, without further ado, let&#39;s go into the details to know the difference between AI and machine learning.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is a machine&#39;s ability to solve tasks that are commonly done by intelligent beings or humans. So, AI allows machines to execute tasks smartly by imitating human abilities. On the other hand, machine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence. It is the process of learning from data that is fed into the machine in the form of algorithms.</p>

                Artificial Intelligence and its Real-World Benefits
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">Artificial intelligence is the science of training computers and machines to perform tasks with human-like intelligence and reasoning skills. With AI in your computer system, you can speak in any accent or any language as long as there is data on the internet about it. AI will be able to pick it up and follow your commands.</p>

              <p class="card__text">We can see the application of this technology in a lot of the online platforms that we enjoy today, such as retail stores, healthcare, finance, fraud detection, weather updates, traffic information and much more. As a matter of fact, there is nothing that AI cannot do.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Machine Learning and its Process
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">This is based on the idea that machines should be able to learn and adapt through experience. Machine learning can be done by giving the computer examples in the form of algorithms. This is how it will learn what to do on the basis of the given examples.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Once the algorithm determines how to draw the right conclusions for any input, it will then apply the knowledge to new data. And that is the life cycle of machine learning. The first step is to collect data for a question you have. Then the next step is to train the algorithm by feeding it to the machine.</p>

              <p class="card__text">You will have to let the machine try it out, then collect feedback and use the information you gained to make the algorithm better and repeat the cycle until you get your desired results. This is how the feedback works for these systems.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Machine learning uses statistics and physics to find specific information within the data, without any specific programming about where to look or what conclusions to draw. These days&#39; machine learning and artificial intelligence are applied to all sorts of technology. Some of them include CT scan, MRI machines, car navigation systems and food apps, to name a few.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                Conclusion
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In simple words, artificial intelligence is the science of creating machines that have human-like properties of reasoning and problem-solving. And this allows machines to learn and make decisions from past data without explicit programming. In short, the goal of AI is to create intelligent machines. And it does that by combining machine learning and deep learning etc.</p>

              <p class="card__text--short">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">AI is short for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a machine or computer program to do thinking and learning like humans. Also, it is a field of study that works on making a computer smarter. The term AI was coined in 1955 by John McCarthy. Let&#39;s find out more about the AI history and some facts.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Generally, this term refers to a machine that has human-like cognitive abilities. For instance, an AI system can learn and solve some problems like us. An ideal intelligent machine can boost its success rate.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Today, the term AI is used to understand human speech and compete at a much higher level in some strategic games like Chess and Go, interpretation of complex data and self-driving cars.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The goal of AI research is developing computer programs that have the ability to think logically and solve problems. However, many apps can solve a lot of problems. Doing math and searching different databases is something that computers can do much better than humans.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Also, AI involves a lot of different fields, such as philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, math and computer science. Researchers are hopeful to develop an AI system that can solve a lot of problems rather than concentrate on just one. Aside from this, researchers are also working hard to develop emotional and creative AI. For this purpose, they have given a go to a lot of tools and approaches.</p>

              <h4 class="card__text--heading text-large weight-5 mt-3 mb-1">
                History of AI
              </h4>

              <p class="card__text">In history, you can find many objects that can be considered Artificially Intelligent. For the first time, these objects of AI appeared in Greek myths, such as Talos of Crete. Aside from this, humanoid robots were designed by Al-Jazari, and Yan Shi.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The ancient Greek mathematicians and Greek philosophers developed formal logic. This gave birth to the idea of computer later on in the 19th century. According to the theory of computation by Alan Turing, all mathematical problems can be solved through the processing of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. Aside from this, advancements in cybernetics, information theory, and neurology convinced many researchers that it was possible to develop an electronic brain.</p>

              <p class="card__text">The research studies on AI began after a conference held at Dartmouth College in the 19th century. During this brainstorming session, many people showed their interest in Artificial Intelligence. During the conference, the researchers presented programs that could beat humans at solving word problems. Also, the department of Defense began investing lots of funds in AI labs and research across the globe.</p>

              <p class="card__text">Unfortunately, most researchers underestimate the complexity of problems. Their tools don&#39;t give common sense or emotions to computers. In 1980s, AI research got a reboot because of the popularity of many systems that mimicked human knowledge. By the end of 1985, around one billion dollars were invested in AI. The advent of faster computers was convincing enough for British and US government to provide plenty of funds for AI once again.</p>

              <p class="card__text">So, this is an introduction to AI that contains history and facts. Hopefully, you will find this article full of useful and interesting information.</p>
